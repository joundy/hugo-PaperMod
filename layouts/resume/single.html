        Near Protocol
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migrated legacy infrastructure to Kubernetes (GKE), performed the cluster setup, containerized all services using Docker, set up IAM & K8s RABAC, and optimized the scaling values. As a results achieved scalable services, robust performance, and easy maintenance on GKE.</li>
        <li>Created an internal tool (JOJO) to support engineers in their day-to-day life. This tool is used for creating service images (Docker), deploying the images into K8s, and versioning. The purpose of this tool is to minimize complexity and repetitive actions, resulting in improved DEX (Developer Experience) and an 70%+ increase in deployment efficiency.</li>
        <li>Implemented a comprehensive monitoring system using tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki. This setup allows us to gather real-time metrics from our services, including logging capabilities and alerting functionality.</li>
        <li>Improved the indexer service to handle massive logs, enabling it to process more than 1000 block's logs per second. This improvement also included the ability to whitelist the Near NFT contract NEP-171, resulting in smooth synchronization between on-chain and off-chain data. Additionally, it has facilitated external projects in integrating the contract immediately.</li>
        <li>Created an NFT trade feature for the smart contract, allowing users to trade their own NFTs with each other. Implemented a refund mechanism to ensure that all approval IDs are successfully approved.</li>
        <li>Created a locked staking feature for the smart contract, enabling users to lock their balances for a period of time and have a chance to earn rewards. This results in a more stable token price for the paras native token.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Created a new authorization service and middleware library, changed the protocol from HTTP to gRPC, and also migrated 50+ services to use the new one, resulting in less bandwidth usage and easier integration with other microservices.</li>
        <li>Successfully tested the authorization service to handle more than 100k RPS during the TVC session, resulting in smooth performance between clients and other microservices.</li>
        <li>Developed a user impersonation feature and integrated it into RABAC. This feature is used by the internal team to impersonate the real user, resulting in easier bug reproduction and securing access for eligible users only.</li>
        <li>Developed a rewarding service, which is used to consolidate all rewards into one service. This includes creating documentation and presenting the PDC (Public Design Challenge) to all engineers.</li>
        <li>Created a real-time leaderboard feature used by 'Ruang Belajar', and successfully tested the leaderboard in real-time with 10k concurrent users, resulting in a better user experience and fair results.</li>

        <li>Designed the database schema for the HR management apps at https://codex.works/ and successfully migrated from SQL to MongoDB. This migration has brought about increased flexibility and faster development.</li>
        <li>Created live coding feature, this feature is used by Codex Assigment App to test user’s coding skills.</li>
        <li>Refactored the legacy codebase into a modern clean architecture structure, resulting in a well-defined layer, improved maintainability, and most importantly, ease in adding new features. </li>
        <li>Became a pioneer to use GraphQL as the main backend protocol, resulting in a 60% reduction in bandwidth usage and facilitating better communication between the server and client through “static typed request/response”</li>
        <li>Optimized the apps by defining database indexes to handle query calls and added a cache mechanism to the app. As a result, the app became faster, more reliable, and lighter to compute.</li>
